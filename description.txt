You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?

Adds the moon from The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask into Terraria, complete with a 3-day cycle and an ocarina to rewind it all.

Can you beat Terraria in three days time?


FEATURES:
	3 day cycle (obviously)
	Ocarina of Time (Can also play the Song of Healing!)
	Miniature clock tower you can equip on vanity to hear the iconic bells at time marches on
	NPCs drop masks when they die that allow you to hold onto them in the next cycle

All is reset when the moon crashes into your world, including your character! (to the last time the Song of Time was played)
Playing the song of time resets the world but preservs your character.


NOTE: Not tested in multiplayer.

For the 2025 tModLoader Mod Jam.
