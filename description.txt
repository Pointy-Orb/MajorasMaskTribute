You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?

Adds the moon from The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask into Terraria, complete with a 3-day cycle and an ocarina to rewind it all.

How many resets will it take for you to beat Terraria?


FEATURES:
	3 day cycle (obviously)
	Ocarina of Time (Can also play the Song of Healing!) (Spawns with new characters, if you lose yours, you can craft one with 5 clay and 10 fallen stars)
	Miniature clock tower you can equip on vanity to hear the iconic bells at time marches on (Any watch, 4 wood, and 10 stone)
	Playing the Song of Healing near NPCs while they are happy enough transforms them into masks, allowing you to bring them with you to the next cycle (an indicator can be seen at the end of their happiness text showing such)
	You can play the Inverted Song of Time when you are in inverted gravity (hold right-click)
	Terminian Watch item grants a Majora's Mask style clock (Take a gold-tier watch and add 4 iron bars at a table and chair)
	"Wand of Sparking" mode that forces you to only retain your first three inventory slots

All is reset when the moon crashes into your world, including your character! (to the last time the Song of Time was played)
Playing the song of time resets the world but preserves your character.

v1.1 changes:
	- Multiplayer compatible!
	- Wand of Sparking mode for those who want an experience similar to that challenge.
	- Reworked blood moons to happen during the final hours (can be changed in config)
	- Reworked solar eclipses to be triggered using a new item that can be obtained after one mech boss (can be changed in config)
	- Checkpoint after starting hardmode can now be disabled.
	- Proper "day of" screens that resemble those from Majora's Mask (can be changed to old verison in config)
	- Config option to use vanilla textures for the moon so that you can use any moon texture pack.
	- Screen-shake strength during final day is now adjustable and can be turned off.
	- Config option that, when turned on, removes the need to kill Plantera to summon Golem.
	- 'Majora's Mask' item obtained post-Moonlord that allows the cycle to be disabled.
	- Fixed draw order of white fade while playing the Song of Time.
	- Final Hours loops more cleanly
	- Modded world and player data is now properly transferred through backups
	- New 'Terminian Watch' item that displays the clock from Majora's Mask
	- And more!
