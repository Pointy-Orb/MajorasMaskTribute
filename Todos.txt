Make NPCs say stuff about Eclipsing Stones and Phase Discs
Look into doing custom cycle lengths
Make the version of the 3D clock for a saved world where the moon isn't falling
Add an indicator for when an NPC is eligible to become a mask (idea: just have an icon appear in the happiness page, have that icon be an unobtainable item with a tooltip giving a direct indicator)
