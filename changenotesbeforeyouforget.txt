 - Added a Final Hours Music Box. If the Miniature Clock Tower is equipped, this will also play the bell while the music box is equipped/player is in music box's vicinity
 - NPC masks are no longer obtained through murder. Instead, you must play the Song of Healing when near them and while they are happy enough (same happiness to sell a pylon). The old method can be restored as a config option if desired.
 - The Miniature Clock Tower can now be placed, as well as toggled on and off.
