 - Added an optional UI element that shows you what day it is when you don't have a watch of any kind (can be forced on or turned off as desired)
 - Added a new command (/cycles) that shows you how many times the world has been reset. This counter only counts resets that have happened after this update has released.
 - A config option has been added that allows the black title cards to only appear when the Miniature Clock Tower is equipped. It is not the default.
