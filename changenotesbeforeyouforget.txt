 - Enemies with worm AI can no longer be transformed by any masks
 - Enabling the config option that allows fighting Golem without killing Plantera first now also allows cultists to spawn in pre-Hardmode
 - Added a new config option that allows the Celestial Sigil to be used without doing Hardmode or having killed Golem, keep vanilla behavior, or to just remove it entirely
 - Added a Doom Monolith which recreates the shader seen during the final night
