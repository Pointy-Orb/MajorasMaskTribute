Terminian Clock display now has its own config scale
Fixed a bug where the Terminian clock would get bigger when opening a chest or shopping
Fixed a bug in Wand of Sparking mode where armor would still appear visible after being erased.
Added a config option that allows the Wall of Flesh to drop demon conches (thanks to Kaleina for the idea)
Added a config option that makes the temple key non-consumable
Eclipse spawning override now uses a GlobalNPC hook instead of IL editing (now it's safer, easier to work with, and more likely to be compatible with other mods)
Fixed some eclipse enemies not dropping loot when an eclipse is summoned through the Eclipsing Stone
Doubled the drop rate of moon's tears
