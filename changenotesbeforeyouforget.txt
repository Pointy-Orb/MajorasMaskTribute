 - Added a new variant of the Terminian Watch that replicates the clock seen in the 3DS remake of Majora's Mask. Its item can be converted to and from the old clock with no extra materials!
 - Seconds part of Terminian Clock final hours timer now counts out of 60 instead of out of 100
 - "Day of" card no longer interrupts gameplay during the Eater of Worlds fight or the Torch God event
 - Fixed a bug where modded tiles generated after Hardmode would disappear after a reset if the Hardmode checkpoint was enabled.
 - Moonlord checkpoint is overall far less janky now
